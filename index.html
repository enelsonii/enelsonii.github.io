                        <p>My name is Eric Nelson II. I am a bay area native, my hometown is Richmond, Ca. I went to the location Richmond High for my first two years of high school. 
                            Yes, I do know Coach Carter and his youngest son (wasn’t in the movie) was my next door neighbor. 
                            Durning my time at Richmond high I discovered that I was pretty athletic, not to mention I grew almost 10 inches during high school, naturally I got into sports. 
                            I played football, basketball, track and field, and baseball on the varsity level. 
                            Out of all sports I played I chose to pursue basketball, after high I went to a junior college in Oakland, then transfer to California Baptist University on a full ride basketball scholarship. 
                            I majored in Business Administration, with a emphasis on management.

                            After basketball, I found a interest in art and tech. 
                            I worked in the Genius Bar at Apple for a few years until I wanted to take on becoming a full time graphic designer. 
                            I mainly work with musicians with their graphic design and cover art needs. After Apple, I moved to New York, during my stay I left a small fingerprint on the city. 
                            My work was posted in Time Square, top 5 moment in my life. And for that I’d like to thank Porter Shields for the opportunity. 
                            Since that moment I wanted to learn more about design and I have passion for technology, I’ve decided to enroll in UC Berkeley Extension Full Stack coding bootcamp.
                            Thank you for visiting my portfolio.
